TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_1=First day at Akadimia, visiting the Floating Islands, capturing a creature… Our heroes could not imagine what had begun that day…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_2=There were great changes in those last days - learning about Creatures, Magic Houses, Glyphs, and finally becoming apprentices.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_3=The students were so happy choosing their houses that none had any idea of what was to come…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_4=Rumors and theories were circulating about a possible accident involving Professor Dyson…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_5=Their actions in battle took attention away from Sandro, considered one of the best young wizards in Akadimia.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_6=As the first trial approached, our heroes became increasingly nervous and excited.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_7=The time had come - the first Trial was upon them, but they could never have imagined what they would have to confront to pass it…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_8=Now within the Ice Caves, they met Professor Sayuri. She was very interested in them after witnessing their battle against the Dragon.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_9=Despite the cold and the darkness, the team kept motivated, focused on what kind of creatures they would now encounter.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_10=Maggie began to doubt the incident. Something told her that all was not as it seemed…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_11=Even within those frozen dark caves, the team remained curious to find which creatures lurked there.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_12=Step by step, without knowing it, their friendship was growing during their journey together through the Ice Caves.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_13=Not as silent as they should have been, the Ice Caves seemed to hide a strange magic.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_14=Time for the second trial, but what creature could possibly surpass the Dragon from the last?

TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_15=So there they were, inside a Volcano with Sandro leading. No-one understood why Belketh needed MacKey in such a hurry…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_16=Their journey passed without further issue, although they were surprised by the fire creatures living there.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_17=Their interest was heightening at each step - new fire creatures, Dwarf runes with ancient histories…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_18=They were fascinated by all the special creatures that they had encountered so far.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_19=All the magic of the place turned their thoughts to the greatest wizards of their generation.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_20=They asked themselves, could they pass these trials that only the greatest wizards had mastered?
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_21=The only hope for our heroes was that, this time, they would not have to face a Dragon…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_22=With another Professor called in by Belketh, our heroes began to find the situation odd... but it was time to focus on the next region.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_23=They decided to focus on the creatures they could capture there. Some could be useful for the last trial.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_24=Maggie appeared to be very enthusiastic about meeting Professor Berhard. It seemed she was a great fan of his.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_25=The entire forest was in harmony, as if every creature was living in a place of peace and balance.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_26=It was while distracted capturing special creatures that they found Kei and Liran once more.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_27=They decided to focus on the creatures they could capture there. Some could be useful for the last trial.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_28=It was to be the final trial. If passed, they would no longer be considered apprentices.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_29=Spirits acting strangely, Belketh calling all Professors… and now a Professor was missing. This was worse than they'd expected.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_30=They were surprised that Sandro had chosen them for a mission as important as rescuing a Professor.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_31=They were all worried about Sayuri. All but Liran, who was more concerned with his own matters…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_32=Maggie was truly amazed to see things she had only ever heard and read about, right there in front of her.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_33=As they progressed through the ruins, they could feel the ancient power of the fallen civilization.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_34=The entire city was empty, and they had begun to lose all hope of finding Professor Sayuri alive...
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_35=They thought they saw someone's silhouette... Armed with courage, they decided to try and discover who it might be and what they were doing there.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_36=Saving Professor Sayuri had granted them access to the World-Tree Mountain… but Kei and Liran decided to go their own way.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_37=Few mages had ever reached these lands. Only those with the highest abilities have access.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_38=They couldn't believe Belketh had approved their visit. It was unusual for new students, and Maggie had her suspicions.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_39=Maggie was quiet for a while, but then suddenly wanted to explain something important to the others…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_40=Maggie was worried about Sandro and Belketh. She had witnessed some of their strange meetings about Dark Magic…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_41=At the beginning, none of the others had trusted her, but they soon began to think - what if she was right?
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_42=Suddenly, something interrupted them. Strange sounds could be heard - something was drawing near…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_43=Maggie had begun to doubt Sandro and Belketh. What were they hiding?
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_44=As they advanced deeper into the desert, they realized where they were - in ancient Shantiri ruins.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_45=Liran began to tire of walking through the desert and started complaining about the Shantiri.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_46=Their journey through the desert became more and more exhausting, and Liran's attitude did not help at all.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_47=The group were becoming annoyed with Liran's attitude, so Maggie tried to entertain him.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_48=Finally, Maggie managed to calm the team enough to be able to enjoy the journey.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_49=As they approached the center of the Shantiri ruins, they had a bad feeling. It was as if something was waiting for them…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_50=They couldn't believe that Kei was dead. This incident would change the relationship of the group forever.

TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_1=Nymphs are pure spirits. They're beautiful but with the bad temper of an ale-intolerant Dwarf.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_2=Don't worry, they're much more dangerous than they sound.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_3=And really what's the worse that can happen? Dismemberment? Yes, that's a possibility, but it can't be all bad can it?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_4=To find one, all we have to do is follow the instructions in Archmage Ammar's seminal treaty on Constructs.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_5=What? You've never heard of Ammar, Lord-General of House Materia? Some Wizard you're going to be!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_6=Which magical House did you select? I joined House Chimera. My best friend Morgana told me it was because I've always wanted a pet Unicorn.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_7=That's silly of course, but I come from the Unicorn Duchy in the Holy Empire and it's true that I've always found these noble steeds fascinating.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_8=I'm surprised you made it this far... It seems Professor Bubbles went easy on you. In my day we'd have lost a couple of students already.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_9=What do you mean lost? Lost as in "giving up" or as in "dying in excruciating pain due to some magical accident and the body was never recovered"?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_10=Yes, more than likely.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_11=Joking of course. I just want to make sure you don't get overconfident.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_12=I mean, having one Professor's mysterious death linked to me is fine, but those of new students on their first day? That would definitely damage my academic record...
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_1=Sayuri seems like a nice and capable teacher, not like that bubbleheaded Elf!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_2=She is the representative of House Anima in our school. It's the oldest House in the Seven Cities.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_3=They studied and refined the ancient Shantiri rituals of Spirit Summoning and Binding.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_4=Don't you think it's strange we haven't even seen Headmaster Belketh yet?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_5=I know he must be busy, what with that Dyson "accident", but you would have thought he'd have stopped by to say hello by now!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_6=Talking of Professor Dyson. I wonder what he would have been like? More to the point, what actually happened to him?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_7=Those caves are anything but cheerful. I'm glad we're facing this challenge together...
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_8=I wish I had brought Potishar’s Incantations for the Studious Mage with me. It would probably have proved handy.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_9=By the way, have I told you my copy is signed by the author?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_1=Professor MacKay is the representative of House Materia at the school. They're the architects and engineers who build the floating cities and siege engines in the Seven Cities.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_2=Some of them prefer to become alchemists to craft magic potions and enchant all kinds of artifacts.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_3=House Materia claim they created the Constructs but in fact they just rediscovered a magical art that was lost with the ancient Shantiri civlisation.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_4=The Golems in this place clearly date back to that time.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_5=Dwarf Runes! I studied them for fun, but these are very old. I think they say "Trespassers will be dismembered and roasted"...
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_6=A traditional Dwarf welcome I guess…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_7=What do you think about Sandro? I've heard he's probably the best Wizard of our generation, and very close to our Headmaster, Belketh.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_8=But here I am, doing all the talking and picking your brains. Such a blabbermouth!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_9=My mother always said I was very verbose. At first, I thought it was some kind of rare, foreign disease.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_1=Professor Berhard is the representative of my House, Chimera, but I heard he's had issues with the current ruling council.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_2=There are dissident schools of thought within House Chimera. Some, like Berhard, learn the ways of the wild magical creatures so they can tame them.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_3=Others train them the hard way, with senseless brutality.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_4=And then there are the Crimson Mages, who create brand new species in their laboratories. That's how the Orcs and Beastmen were born.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_5=Berhard's views on how we should be kind to our creatures are the topic of Gailbraith's famous treatise "Fantastic Beasts and How to Befriend Them".
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_6=I've read it ten times already, including once in the original Ancient Draconic version!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_7=We really were that close to being burnt to a crisp down in that volcano! I was super scared it would totally ruin my hair!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_8=But you know what? I've discovered this volcanic ash is wonderful for the skin! You just need to exfoliate. Big, circular motions…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_9=Quiet, Liran! Is your appearance all you worry about?!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_10=What else is there?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_1=Dragons, singularities in the Spirit World, strange disappearances… This is really not how I pictured school life.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_2=And you didn’t even mention the school meals! I’m putting on pounds here!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_3=Sometimes I wonder what life must be like for people without perfect facial bone structure...
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_4=Are you suggesting my bone structure is imperfect?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_5=No. Why suggest when you can simply look in a mirror and see for yourself?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_6=I know you like books Maggie. Have you read this one?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_7=It's a list of secret beauty potion recipes compiled by a mysterious House Materia Wizard only known as the "Half-Blond Prince"!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_8=I believe true beauty comes from within!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_9=That's OK Maggie. You keep telling yourself that. I'm sure it's a comfort to you.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_1=I've heard you stood your ground against the Naga Warlord. Guess a duo of halfwits adds up to full wit after all.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_2=Yes, super job!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_3=I was being sarcastic, you idiot!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_4=Anyway, we'll go our way, you go yours. We don't want you two holding us back.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_5=My thoughts exactly!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_6=I overheard Liran and Bubbles talking. Liran is Bubbles’s nephew!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_7=I was wondering how he ever got through the entrance examination for Akademia…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_8=I've witnessed some strange meetings between Sandro and Belketh and I'm beginning to wonder if the two of them have more than a purely academic fascination with Dark Magic.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_9=Do you know that Belketh's master was none other than Sar-Shazzar? Have you read his Prophecy of the Dark Messiah? No? You're not into epic poems? Or apocalyptic imagery?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_1=Sandro and Belketh are definitely keeping something from us… They better not expect me to stand still and keep quiet. I would even risk being expelled!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_2=For once I agree with you. How can they expect to move me away from the only challenge worthy of my skills?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_3=I went on a tan-cation once in the Sahaar and all anyone would talk about it was Shantiri this, Shantiri that. I thought it was a local cocktail.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_4=But in fact it was just some dead civilisation, ancient ruins, Dark Magic, blah, blah, blah. Bo-ring…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_5=I would clearly have preferred something fruity with a cherry and a little umbrella on top!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_6=Who's your favorite of the three founders of the Seven Cities? Sar-Shazzar, Sar-Issus, or Sar-Aggreth?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_7=For me, it's Sar-Issus. After all, we owe him the very first principles of Arcane Magic!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_8=Is that why their tombs are called Sar-cophaguses?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_9=Are you being Sar-castic now Liran? And just so you know, the plural of Sarcophagus is Sarcophagi…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_8_1=I can't believe Kei's dead… She was my best friend… She was my only friend.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_8_2=Not anymore. We're your friends now. We're in this together.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_8_3=From now on I'll dress only in black and dye my hair white... Because you have to offset.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_8_4=I was so wrong about everything, Liran and Kei, Sandro, Belketh. I thought I was so smart…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_8_5=We have to pull ourselves together. There was nothing that any of us could have done. This all started with Dyson.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_8_6=Maybe there's something we can find in the Fire Maze that will help us defeat Ar-Kenos…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_1=Sandro is so different with you. He's usually not so… warm.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_2=I am the only member of his family that he will have any contact with, and even that's infrequent. He is… not easy, shall we say.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_3=What happened?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_4=It's a long story, a very long story.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_5=So why doesn't Sandro talk to the rest of your family?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_6=Alejandro was sent to a seminary to become a Priest of the Light, but that didn’t work out well…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_7=So he left the Holy Empire to become a Wizard, here, in the Seven Cities.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_8=Has Sandro always been so strange?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_9=Our mother died giving birth to him, and at first it seemed Alejandro himself was stillborn. It's a miracle he survived.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_10=He was always an odd and precocious child. He used to tell us stories of mysterious places and times like he had been there.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_11=Later we came to realize he had a strong connection with the Spirit World, perhaps because the shadow of death fell upon him when he was born...

TID_TUTORIAL_SPECIAL_DUNGEON_02=In the Dragonmist Islands you can find <color=white>evolution materials</color>! Let's go take a look! But be careful - some of these dungeons change every day!
TID_MAIN_LORE_INTRODUCTION_0000=Hi, I'm Maggie! Isn’t it brilliant, being admitted to <color=white>Akadimia</color>, the most prestigious school of Magic in the <color=white>Seven Cities</color>?
TID_MAIN_LORE_INTRODUCTION_0001=Hello, and welcome students to Akadimia! I am professor Yrilin, which means "Song of the Stars" in Elven.
TID_MAIN_LORE_INTRODUCTION_0002=I've heard that around here, everyone calls her <color=white>"Bubbles"</color>. I'm eager to know why…
TID_MAIN_LORE_INTRODUCTION_0003=I am the school's Dean of Students. Lucky you - you'll be seeing quite a bit of me… every now and again.
TID_MAIN_LORE_INTRODUCTION_0004=I'm also your instructor for <color=white>Air Magic</color>, which means I will be your supervisor for today's field trip in the <color=white>Floating Islands</color>, where you'll be undertaking your first test, the <color=white>Trial of Air</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_INTRODUCTION_0005=Your first task is really trivial. I just need you to <color=white>obtain a Nymph</color>. One of those flying Spirits, you know.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0000=These are your <color=white>first missions</color>...You seem lost, but don't worry, follow me - I think I know where to find a Nymph.
TID_TUTORIAL_INTRO_BATTLE1_01=Look, a Nymph! Let's capture it! There are creatures hidden in each region, so pay attention to the ones you visit.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0001=Bravo, you've captured the Nymph! Now put that theory into practice!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0002=Glyphs are coalesced Magic, refined from Dragonblood Veins and Nexuses - the crème de la crème of arcane enchantments.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0003=Ooh, Look at me with the big words! In simpler terms, they're pretty coloured symbols that make your creatures stronger. Easy peasy!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0004=Now too-da-loo! You all have fun Glyph-hunting!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0005=Good job students! This Glyph is your first step in an exciting journey! Let me show you the best way to obtain creatures...
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0006=Congratulations students! Here's your reward! It's called a Soulstone and it's the Spiritual Quintessence of a Magical creature.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0007=Sorry, big words again! Basically it's a beautiful shimmering thing that you consume at the Summoning Gate, and voilà! A new creature appears, bound to you.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0008=Well, this is your lucky day! Here is another Soulstone for you.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0009=Not all Soulstones are created equal, you know. The purer the magic inside, the better they look, and the stronger the creature they summon.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0000=Gather round students. I have bad news. Unfortunately there's been a slight accident involving Professor Dyson, your Water Magic teacher.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0001=A "slight accident"? I heard he's been sucked into a rift to the Spirit World that he himself created.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0002=Perhaps… But "accident" has a nicer ring. And we don't want you to get in a tizzy and all.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0003=A substitute teacher is already on the way. She's a Naga from Shanriya, the Hidden City. I'm sure you'll like her! Unless you're allergic to snakes of course.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0004=Anyway, thing is Master Belketh has ordered the academic staff to investigate the matter, and that includes me, obviously.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0005=But the good news is your Trial won't be interrupted! <color=white>Sandro</color>, our headboy and, I must say, brightest student, will guide you through the last tasks.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0006=Erm, thanks Professor Yrilin. Well First Years, it's time to prove yourselves and see whether you are worthy of your place here at Akadimia.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0007=Spread out. <color=white>From now on, you're on your own</color>. Show me your best. You won't see me but I'll be there, watching, judging…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0011=What? A <color=white>Dragon!</color> This is our Trial? Are you crazy?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0012=Dragons... we put too much emphasis on them. They are not gods, little more than beasts really; much like squirrels, though admittedly far more likely to eat you.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_CONCLUSION_0000=Good job. Off you go now, to the <color=white>Ice Caves</color> for the <color=white>Trial of Water</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_CONCLUSION_0001=Is that all you've got to say! "Good job"? We could have been killed by that Dragon!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_CONCLUSION_0002=Yes, but you weren't. Now hurry along, <color=white>Professor Sayuri</color> is waiting for you.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_INTRODUCTION_0000="I set eyes upon you for the first time, students. I am <color=white>Mistress Sayuri</color>, your new teacher for the studies of <color=white>Water Magic</color> and Spirit Summoning."
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_INTRODUCTION_0001=You're Professor Dyson's replacement? What happened to him? Everyone is being so tight lipped!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_INTRODUCTION_0002=I would be honored to invite you for tea and discuss this matter, but I'm afraid your next assignment can't wait.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_INTRODUCTION_0003=Let me guess… We have to find a way to breathe underwater so we can dive down to the sunken city of Merfolk and rescue the person we care the most about.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_INTRODUCTION_0004=Saaa… Not at all. You're to venture into a lost Faceless city, frozen deep into the Icy Mountain, and find out what lies hidden and silent in its shadows…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_INTRODUCTION_0005=Brilliant! Is it just me or are you also picturing some kind of dark oozing tentacles sucking at our souls with disgusting sounds and no table manners whatsoever?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_LEVEL_0000=Not so bad first years. Maybe there's hope for you after all. But beware, you're now in the Heart of Darkness, metaphorically speaking.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_LEVEL_0001=One final challenge to go before you can, you know, "chill out"…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0000=Well done students! You've passed the <color=white>Trial of Water</color>, and also learned that working as a team makes you stronger.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0001=So it was just another Dragon... How original! The tentacles would at least have brought some "freshness" to the test…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0002=Do not mock the Dragons little one. They created our world and inspire us continuously, encouraging us to surpass ourselves.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0003=In the Holy Empire, where I come from, we worship <color=white>Elrath</color>, the <color=white>Dragon-God of Light</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0004=But he's supposed to be almighty, and here we are - first years - defeating two Dragons in a row!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0005=I thought you were more perceptive. The Dragons allowed you to defeat them. They're testing your abilities.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0006=Believe me, it would take you more than a lifetime of magical studies to represent a real threat to any of them…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0007=I would love to teach you more about the Dragons, but unfortunately, your next challenge awaits. I must send you to <color=white>Professor MacKay</color>, the <color=white>Master of Fire</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0000=Hey-ho! Welcome lads and lasses, come closer to the fires of my forge. Don't be afraid to get your wee fingers burnt!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0001=Easy for him to say - Dwarves have a natural resistance to Fire. They could go skinny-dipping in lava pools without even feeling a tingle!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0002=I'm <color=white>Professor MacKay</color>, your teacher for the studies of <color=white>Fire Magic</color> and Construct Crafting.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0003=Fire can become your best pal, but ya have to treat it with respect or, believe me, it'll crawl up your sorry arse faster than a cinder louse!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0004=Apologies, sir, but <color=white>Master Belketh</color> requires your presence for… extraordinary academic matters.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0005=Aye, must be this fishy business with ol’ Dyson. Told him many a time not to mess with things ya cannae understand…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0006=Shall I dismiss the first years and postpone the <color=white>Trial of Fire</color>?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0007=No need Sandro, just take these wee bairns up to see ol’ Smoky for me.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0008=I trust ya to bring them back to me in one piece, not as a heap of charred kebabs!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0000=Hush now... I think we're being followed… I recognize these students - they're first years, like us.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0001=Really, a volcano! Do you realise what that’ll do to our skin? We need to moisturize! Do you know any water spray spells <color=white>Kei</color>?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0002=Shut up <color=white>Liran</color>. I'm trying to focus here. I can hear a rumble that does not seem to be caused by natural causes, and if my intuition is right…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0003=Kei! Look out! There are two other students right ahead, that smartass girl and… er, whatsisname.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0004=Rivals eh? Well nobody messes with MY Trial! Prepare for trouble!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0005=Yeah! And make it double!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0006=Guys, we'd love to challenge you in the arena but now is neither the place nor the time.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0007=Your "Trial" has heard us and he's "warming up" to roast our collective butts!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0008=It seems MacKay's "ol' Smoky" is *surprise* yet another <color=white>Dragon!</color>
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_CONCLUSION_0000=So lads and lasses, hope you've enjoyed the scenery down there. Dwarven architecture is such a wonder!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_CONCLUSION_0001=But ya ain't seen nothing till you've crawled your arse down the Lost Mines of Doria!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_CONCLUSION_0002=I thought Doria was the famous House Chimera explorer who went missing in the Wyslin jungle?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_CONCLUSION_0003=Missing? She was torn to pieces by a giant blue ape while trying to befriend it!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_CONCLUSION_0004=She was far too young to be wandering around a jungle by herself. I mean, what were her parents thinking!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0000=Right then me little possums, I'm <color=white>Professor Berhard</color>, your teacher for the studies of <color=white>Earth Magic</color> and Magic Beast Training.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0001=Your Trial will take place in a forest that's sacred to <color=white>Sylanna</color>, our <color=white>good old Mother Nature</color>, and occasionally <color=white>Dragon-Goddess of Earth</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0002=Here you all will take your next steps and dig to the roots (so to speak) of creature control.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0003=Now I say control, but these little fellows of yours should be treated with respect, more like partners.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0004=Pardon me sir. Headmaster Belketh has sent me to guide the first years through the Trial. Your expertise is requested for… urgent pest control issues.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0005=Go on then. You don’t keep an Angel waiting!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0006=Really sorry I ain't got time to lollygag with youse all day... I'll see you around when you come back from the Trial.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_LEVEL_0000=I hope the final <color=white>Earth Trial</color> challenge isn't just another Dragon!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_CONCLUSION_0000=Youse all have potential, I’ll give ya that. Just mind them critters and they’ll mind you!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_CONCLUSION_0001=Got to lurve nature, it’s all around us see. Take this cute little hairy critter. Come ‘ere let me rub yer belly. See how he loves it?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_CONCLUSION_0002=Er… sir, that’s Professor MacKay!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_CONCLUSION_0003=That's fine. There ya go, that's it. To the left a bit. Ahhh, that's the spot.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0000=Have you noticed that the school’s spirit creatures have been acting strangely?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0001=They are attuned to realms beyond our sight you know. Maybe we should raise this with Master Belketh?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0002=You two, let's put your overly inquisitive minds to good use. <color=white>Professor Sayuri</color> is missing.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0003=Headmaster Belketh has asked me to investigate the nearby Naga city personally to see whether there’s a connection with these strange events.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0004=I'm leading the search team, and you're coming with me.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0005=Do all first years have to go?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0006=Only the ones I consider expendable... I mean capable.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_LEVEL_0000=Professor Sayuri! What are you doing down there?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_LEVEL_0001=I'm following clues left by Professor Dyson to try and understand what happened to him. It seems connected with ancient Shantiri lore.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_LEVEL_0002=And they're leading to the <color=white>World-Tree Mountain</color>, another important Shantiri site.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_LEVEL_0003=Don't worry I'm going back to Akadimia to tell Belketh about it, and you should leave too.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_LEVEL_0004=Too late. Seems the city was not completely abandoned after all…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_LEVEL_0005=A <color=white>Daimyo</color>! His kind dedicate their existence to a sole purpose; that of the absolute mastery of the art of war.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_CONCLUSION_0000=There you are! I’ve been looking everywhere for you! The nice little candy store, the haunted bathroom, that seedy pub, even the cabinet of secrets...
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_CONCLUSION_0001=And here I find you in these mouldy, decrepit, smelly ruins… Yucky!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_CONCLUSION_0002=But…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_CONCLUSION_0003=No buts! Everyone back to Akidimia. The Headmaster has ordered us to leave immediately. Something about a great cataclysm…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_6_INTRODUCTION_0000=Students. Professor Sayuri has told me everything. I thank you for your help, and I've agreed with her that you should be allowed to explore the World-Tree Mountain.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_6_INTRODUCTION_0001=But don't take that as an excuse to miss classes! Your graduation test is getting close…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_6_INTRODUCTION_0002=So that's our Headmaster. He really is an Angel after all! I've seen my lot in the Holy Empire but there's something different about him…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_6_LEVEL_0000=Oh man, this is awesome! I love this place! I used to come here for picnics with my family.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_6_LEVEL_0001=What are you doing! Why do you constantly help these morons?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_6_LEVEL_0002=Morons? But I thought they were fellow students!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_INTRODUCTION_0000=Students, whether by chance or intuition you have found what we were searching for.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_INTRODUCTION_0001=However, though we appreciate your help. We are your guardians and cannot put your lives at risk.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_INTRODUCTION_0002=Dyson was looking for an ancient Shantiri Tomb buried deep in the <color=white>Colossus desert</color>. This area has been devastated by wild, ancient magic, and it's still highly dangerous.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0000=I have a bad feeling about this. Maybe we should have listened to the Headmaster… Let's go back to Akadimia.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0001=Huh, teacher's pet! Chicken out if you want, but I'm going to show who's the real talent here.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0002=Kei, what have you done! You've triggered some kind of mechanism!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0003=Finally my long sleep is over! Though another hundred years or so wouldn’t have gone amiss.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0004=Kei! No! Monster, what are you doing to her?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0005=So much vitality, brimming with magic and youth… Centuries of torpor make you weak and parched, you know?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0006=Kei - she's so pale and withered, she'll die! Do something, please!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0007=Nothing like a snack to perk you up! Now I feel strong enough to summon one of those good old-fashioned space-time continuum exit vortexes.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0008=And while I escape, I'll let you punch your angry little fists on my <color=white>Titan</color> bodyguard. Because, you know, that's what evil masterminds do.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0009=Next time we meet, you’ll need to be of a much higher level to actually defeat me. And I don’t see that happening…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_INTRODUCTION_0000=What have you done? You were told not to meddle! Your disobedience has awakened an ancient evil, a <color=white>Shantiri King</color> known for his mastery of <color=white>Dark Magic</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_INTRODUCTION_0001=I will deal with you later, but now you need to pass the <color=white>Fire Maze</color> if you are to complete this year at all.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_LEVEL_0000=Hey kids, I just wanted to thank you for bringing your friend along. Just what the doctor ordered.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_LEVEL_0001=You monster! We've pulverized your Titan, and now we'll kick your skinny wrapped-up Mummy bottom!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_LEVEL_0002=Well, technically you cannot harm me. I'm just a projected mirror image. You see, I'm still not fully "spellimus invigoratus" so to speak.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_LEVEL_0004=And when I say "kill you" I mean tear your beating hearts, and then your shrieking souls, from your shredded, convulsing bodies. Now, won’t that be a hoot?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_LEVEL_0005=But I guess I'll have to take a ticket and stand in line. There's a huge, fiery, bearded statue mumbling about a "Trial" and crushing your bones to pulp.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_CONCLUSION_0000=We did it, but I don't feel like celebrating... Look at all the first year students, oblivious to everything that's going on behind the scenes.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_CONCLUSION_0001=For all her faults, Kei should have been here with us.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_CONCLUSION_0002=Raise your head little one. There's a time for tears and a time for blood.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_CONCLUSION_0003=Just as the snake sheds its skin to embrace its new life, we must leave the past where it belongs and prepare for what's ahead of us.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_CONCLUSION_0004=Overly poetic, but essentially correct. You've all exceeded expectations, and we will need you all in the coming battle against Ar-Kenos.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0000=We have an extraordinary visitor. Please meet my sister, <color=white>Alma</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0001=You're a Sister of the Light! I too am from the Holy Empire, the Unicorn Duchy.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0002=Alejandro and I are from the Bull Duchy. Though we tread different paths, we have always remained close.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0003=Alejandro?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0004=Alejandro is no more. I am Sandro now.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0005=Alma has come seeking aid against a Dark Wizard who is corrupting a border town of the Holy Empire.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0006=The Wizard's description fits our soul-reaving Mummy King, <color=white>Ar-Kenos</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0007=Alejandro, no one is supposed to know!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0008=Don't worry, they have already encountered Ar-Kenos, and they will even join us to put him back in his tomb, permanently!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0009=The sooner we set off the better!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0000=So the Dark Wizard is indeed our Shantiri mummy, Ar-Kenos.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0001=In the name of Elrath, Dragon-God of Light, I will cleanse this land of your unholy presence!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0002=Oh, hello! Surprised you made it this far.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0003=No not them, you. Yes, you, the one tapping on me with those greasy fingers of yours.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0004=Haven’t you got anything better to do? Why don’t you go take a walk and let me defeat these imbeciles in peace?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0005=Alright, your call. Anyway, back to the pretty lady sporting a white robe and righteous indignation.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0006=Eeny, meeny, miny, moe… It's your soul that I'll swallow…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0007=Alma! Beast, release her or…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0008=Or what? You'll rip your flesh apart until your face is a naked skull and you'll stare long and hard at me with unblinking eyes?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0009=For someone who has slept for centuries I don’t really have any patience… Maybe I just feel the need to catch up fast.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0000=Really? And this is the best I could get? Doesn’t a villain like me deserve more than a marginal defeat in a mobile game?!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0001=I was thinking more along the lines of an epic HD massively-multiplayer raid! No?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0002=Oh well, the Shantiri Empire was not built in a day. But trust me - this isn't over. I'll be back, just you wait…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0003=Alma! No! You were the only one! I have nothing, nothing…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0004=Calm down Sandro. Maybe there is a way… We'll talk later.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0005=Headmaster, it seems it really isn't over yet. I can still feel the Darkness clutching at us.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0006=It's not merely Dark Magic, Sayuri. Dyson has released something that is even more powerful and dreadful.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0007=Come now students, it is time to return to your classes.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0008=They're not students anymore. They have earned the right to be called Wizards.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0009=Wizards! But it's a heavy title to bear and I fear whatever lies ahead will test us to the limit…
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0000=You are now ready to participate in the <color=white>Arena</color>.
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0001=This is where you can <color=white>challenge other Wizards</color>. Every battle will cost you some <color=white>Arena Energy</color>, but the rewards on offer are unique.
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0002=First of all, you need to <color=white>set your defense team</color>. These are the creatures that other students will see when they try to attack you.
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0003=Good! Now try to defeat some other students!
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0004=You've obtained <color=white>enough points to purchase a reward</color>!
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0005=A new <color=white>building has opened</color>. You can now participate in the <color=white>quest of the maze</color>.
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0006=You can <color=white>select a team</color> and send it into the maze!
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0007=Be careful though - your creatures will be gone for a while and <color=white>unable to follow you into the dungeons</color> during that time.
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0008=Sending your team <color=white>costs 1 Quest Ticket</color>. There are <color=white>many ways to obtain Tickets</color>, but you should still use them wisely.
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0009=Check your team's progress!
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0010=You can let them fulfill this quest on their own - they don't need your help!

TID_CREATURE_LORE_127=Like Goblins, Cyclopes were the result of a "failure" during the Orc experiment. Born from the blood of major demons, they became monstrous giants, their body and mind twisted by chaotic surges.

TID_CREATURE_LORE_128=Devout followers of the cult of the Spider Goddess who aspire to the calling of the warrior, covering their face with the Death Mask in honor of Her name. Some are said to die of fright upon simply seeing the face of death exhibited by the Ebon Knight.
