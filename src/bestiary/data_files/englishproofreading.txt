TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_1=First day at Akadimia, visiting the Floating Islands, capturing a creature… Our heroes could not imagine what had begun that day…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_2=There were great changes in those last days - learning about Creatures, Magic Houses, Glyphs, and finally becoming apprentices.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_3=The students were so happy choosing their houses that none had any idea of what was to come…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_4=Rumors and theories were circulating about a possible accident involving Professor Dyson…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_5=Their actions in battle took attention away from Sandro, considered one of the best young wizards in Akadimia.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_6=As the first trial approached, our heroes became increasingly nervous and excited.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_7=The time had come - the first Trial was upon them, but they could never have imagined what they would have to confront to pass it…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_8=Now within the Ice Caves, they met Professor Sayuri. She was very interested in them after witnessing their battle against the Dragon.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_9=Despite the cold and the darkness, the team kept motivated, focused on what kind of creatures they would now encounter.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_10=Maggie began to doubt the incident. Something told her that all was not as it seemed…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_11=Even within those frozen dark caves, the team remained curious to find which creatures lurked there.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_12=Step by step, without knowing it, their friendship was growing during their journey together through the Ice Caves.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_13=Not as silent as they should have been, the Ice Caves seemed to hide a strange magic.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_14=Time for the second trial, but what creature could possibly surpass the Dragon from the last?

TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_15=So there they were, inside a Volcano with Sandro leading. No-one understood why Belketh needed MacKey in such a hurry…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_16=Their journey passed without further issue, although they were surprised by the fire creatures living there.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_17=Their interest was heightening at each step - new fire creatures, Dwarf runes with ancient histories…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_18=They were fascinated by all the special creatures that they had encountered so far.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_19=All the magic of the place turned their thoughts to the greatest wizards of their generation.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_20=They asked themselves, could they pass these trials that only the greatest wizards had mastered?
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_21=The only hope for our heroes was that, this time, they would not have to face a Dragon…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_22=With another Professor called in by Belketh, our heroes began to find the situation odd... but it was time to focus on the next region.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_23=They decided to focus on the creatures they could capture there. Some could be useful for the last trial.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_24=Maggie appeared to be very enthusiastic about meeting Professor Berhard. It seemed she was a great fan of his.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_25=The entire forest was in harmony, as if every creature was living in a place of peace and balance.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_26=It was while distracted capturing special creatures that they found Kei and Liran once more.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_27=They decided to focus on the creatures they could capture there. Some could be useful for the last trial.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_28=It was to be the final trial. If passed, they would no longer be considered apprentices.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_29=Spirits acting strangely, Belketh calling all Professors… and now a Professor was missing. This was worse than they'd expected.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_30=They were surprised that Sandro had chosen them for a mission as important as rescuing a Professor.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_31=They were all worried about Sayuri. All but Liran, who was more concerned with his own matters…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_32=Maggie was truly amazed to see things she had only ever heard and read about, right there in front of her.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_33=As they progressed through the ruins, they could feel the ancient power of the fallen civilization.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_34=The entire city was empty, and they had begun to lose all hope of finding Professor Sayuri alive...
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_35=They thought they saw someone's silhouette... Armed with courage, they decided to try and discover who it might be and what they were doing there.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_36=Saving Professor Sayuri had granted them access to the World-Tree Mountain… but Kei and Liran decided to go their own way.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_37=Few mages had ever reached these lands. Only those with the highest abilities have access.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_38=They couldn't believe Belketh had approved their visit. It was unusual for new students, and Maggie had her suspicions.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_39=Maggie was quiet for a while, but then suddenly wanted to explain something important to the others…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_40=Maggie was worried about Sandro and Belketh. She had witnessed some of their strange meetings about Dark Magic…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_41=At the beginning, none of the others had trusted her, but they soon began to think - what if she was right?
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_42=Suddenly, something interrupted them. Strange sounds could be heard - something was drawing near…
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_43=Maggie had begun to doubt Sandro and Belketh. What were they hiding?
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_44=As they advanced deeper into the desert, they realized where they were - in ancient Shantiri ruins.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_45=Liran began to tire of walking through the desert and started complaining about the Shantiri.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_46=Their journey through the desert became more and more exhausting, and Liran's attitude did not help at all.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_47=The group were becoming annoyed with Liran's attitude, so Maggie tried to entertain him.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_48=Finally, Maggie managed to calm the team enough to be able to enjoy the journey.
TID_MAP_LEVEL_LORE_49=As they approached the center of the Shantiri ruins, they had a bad feeling. It was as if something was waiting for them…

TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_1=Nymphs are pure spirits. They're beautiful but with the bad temper of an ale-intolerant Dwarf.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_2=Don't worry, they're much more dangerous than they sound.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_3=And really what's the worse that can happen? Dismemberment? Yes, that's a possibility, but it can't be all bad can it?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_4=To find one, all we have to do is follow the instructions in Archmage Ammar's seminal treaty on Constructs.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_5=What? You've never heard of Ammar, Lord-General of House Materia? Some Wizard you're going to be!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_6=Which magical House did you select? I joined House Chimera. My best friend Morgana told me it was because I've always wanted a pet Unicorn.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_7=That's silly of course, but I come from the Unicorn Duchy in the Holy Empire and it's true that I've always found these noble steeds fascinating.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_8=I'm surprised you made it this far... It seems Professor Bubbles went easy on you. In my day we'd have lost a couple of students already.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_9=What do you mean lost? Lost as in "giving up" or as in "dying in excruciating pain due to some magical accident and the body was never recovered"?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_10=Yes, more than likely.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_11=Joking of course. I just want to make sure you don't get overconfident.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_1_12=I mean, having one Professor's mysterious death linked to me is fine, but those of new students on their first day? That would definitely damage my academic record...
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_1=Sayuri seems like a nice and capable teacher, not like that bubbleheaded Elf!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_2=She is the representative of House Anima in our school. It's the oldest House in the Seven Cities.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_3=They studied and refined the ancient Shantiri rituals of Spirit Summoning and Binding.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_4=Don't you think it's strange we haven't even seen Headmaster Belketh yet?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_5=I know he must be busy, what with that Dyson "accident", but you would have thought he'd have stopped by to say hello by now!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_6=Talking of Professor Dyson. I wonder what he would have been like? More to the point, what actually happened to him?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_7=Those caves are anything but cheerful. I'm glad we're facing this challenge together...
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_8=I wish I had brought Potishar’s Incantations for the Studious Mage with me. It would probably have proved handy.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_2_9=By the way, have I told you my copy is signed by the author?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_1=Professor MacKay is the representative of House Materia at the school. They're the architects and engineers who build the floating cities and siege engines in the Seven Cities.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_2=Some of them prefer to become alchemists to craft magic potions and enchant all kinds of artifacts.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_3=House Materia claim they created the Constructs but in fact they just rediscovered a magical art that was lost with the ancient Shantiri civlisation.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_4=The Golems in this place clearly date back to that time.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_5=Dwarf Runes! I studied them for fun, but these are very old. I think they say "Trespassers will be dismembered and roasted"...
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_6=A traditional Dwarf welcome I guess…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_7=What do you think about Sandro? I've heard he's probably the best Wizard of our generation, and very close to our Headmaster, Belketh.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_8=But here I am, doing all the talking and picking your brains. Such a blabbermouth!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_3_9=My mother always said I was very verbose. At first, I thought it was some kind of rare, foreign disease.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_1=Professor Berhard is the representative of my House, Chimera, but I heard he's had issues with the current ruling council.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_2=There are dissident schools of thought within House Chimera. Some, like Berhard, learn the ways of the wild magical creatures so they can tame them.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_3=Others train them the hard way, with senseless brutality.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_4=And then there are the Crimson Mages, who create brand new species in their laboratories. That's how the Orcs and Beastmen were born.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_5=Berhard's views on how we should be kind to our creatures are the topic of Gailbraith's famous treatise "Fantastic Beasts and How to Befriend Them".
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_6=I've read it ten times already, including once in the original Ancient Draconic version!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_7=We really were that close to being burnt to a crisp down in that volcano! I was super scared it would totally ruin my hair!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_8=But you know what? I've discovered this volcanic ash is wonderful for the skin! You just need to exfoliate. Big, circular motions…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_9=Quiet, Liran! Is your appearance all you worry about?!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_4_10=What else is there?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_1=Dragons, singularities in the Spirit World, strange disappearances… This is really not how I pictured school life.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_2=And you didn’t even mention the school meals! I’m putting on pounds here!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_3=Sometimes I wonder what life must be like for people without perfect facial bone structure...
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_4=Are you suggesting my bone structure is imperfect?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_5=No. Why suggest when you can simply look in a mirror and see for yourself?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_6=I know you like books Maggie. Have you read this one?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_7=It's a list of secret beauty potion recipes compiled by a mysterious House Materia Wizard only known as the "Half-Blond Prince"!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_8=I believe true beauty comes from within!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_5_9=That's OK Maggie. You keep telling yourself that. I'm sure it's a comfort to you.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_1=I've heard you stood your ground against the Naga Warlord. Guess a duo of halfwits adds up to full wit after all.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_2=Yes, super job!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_3=I was being sarcastic, you idiot!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_4=Anyway, we'll go our way, you go yours. We don't want you two holding us back.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_5=My thoughts exactly!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_6=I overheard Liran and Bubbles talking. Liran is Bubbles’s nephew!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_7=I was wondering how he ever got through the entrance examination for Akademia…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_8=I've witnessed some strange meetings between Sandro and Belketh and I'm beginning to wonder if the two of them have more than a purely academic fascination with Dark Magic.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_6_9=Do you know that Belketh's master was none other than Sar-Shazzar? Have you read his Prophecy of the Dark Messiah? No? You're not into epic poems? Or apocalyptic imagery?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_1=Sandro and Belketh are definitely keeping something from us… They better not expect me to stand still and keep quiet. I would even risk being expelled!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_2=For once I agree with you. How can they expect to move me away from the only challenge worthy of my skills?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_3=I went on a tan-cation once in the Sahaar and all anyone would talk about it was Shantiri this, Shantiri that. I thought it was a local cocktail.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_4=But in fact it was just some dead civilisation, ancient ruins, Dark Magic, blah, blah, blah. Bo-ring…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_5=I would clearly have preferred something fruity with a cherry and a little umbrella on top!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_6=Who's your favorite of the three founders of the Seven Cities? Sar-Shazzar, Sar-Issus, or Sar-Aggreth?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_7=For me, it's Sar-Issus. After all, we owe him the very first principles of Arcane Magic!
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_8=Is that why their tombs are called Sar-cophaguses?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_7_9=Are you being Sar-castic now Liran? And just so you know, the plural of Sarcophagus is Sarcophagi…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_8_1=I can't believe Kei's dead… She was my best friend… She was my only friend.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_8_2=Not anymore. We're your friends now. We're in this together.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_8_3=From now on I'll dress only in black and dye my hair white... Because you have to offset.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_8_4=I was so wrong about everything, Liran and Kei, Sandro, Belketh. I thought I was so smart…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_8_5=We have to pull ourselves together. There was nothing that any of us could have done. This all started with Dyson.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_8_6=Maybe there's something we can find in the Fire Maze that will help us defeat Ar-Kenos…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_1=Sandro is so different with you. He's usually not so… warm.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_2=I am the only member of his family that he will have any contact with, and even that's infrequent. He is… not easy, shall we say.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_3=What happened?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_4=It's a long story, a very long story.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_5=So why doesn't Sandro talk to the rest of your family?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_6=Alejandro was sent to a seminary to become a Priest of the Light, but that didn’t work out well…
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_7=So he left the Holy Empire to become a Wizard, here, in the Seven Cities.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_8=Has Sandro always been so strange?
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_9=Our mother died giving birth to him, and at first it seemed Alejandro himself was stillborn. It's a miracle he survived.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_10=He was always an odd and precocious child. He used to tell us stories of mysterious places and times like he had been there.
TID_LORE_OPTIONAL_REGION_9_11=Later we came to realize he had a strong connection with the Spirit World, perhaps because the shadow of death fell upon him when he was born...

TID_TUTORIAL_SPECIAL_DUNGEON_01=We are flying over the <color=white>Dragonmist Islands</color>! The Dungeons to be found here are priceless.
TID_TUTORIAL_SPECIAL_DUNGEON_02=In the Dragonmist Islands you can find <color=white>evolution materials</color>! Let's go take a look! But be careful - some of these dungeons change every day!
TID_MAIN_LORE_INTRODUCTION_0000=Hi, I'm Maggie! Isn’t it brilliant, being admitted to <color=white>Akadimia</color>, the most prestigious school of Magic in the <color=white>Seven Cities</color>?
TID_MAIN_LORE_INTRODUCTION_0001=Hello, and welcome students to Akadimia! I am professor Yrilin, which means "Song of the Stars" in Elven.
TID_MAIN_LORE_INTRODUCTION_0002=I've heard that around here, everyone calls her <color=white>"Bubbles"</color>. I'm eager to know why…
TID_MAIN_LORE_INTRODUCTION_0003=I am the school's Dean of Students. Lucky you - you'll be seeing quite a bit of me… every now and again.
TID_MAIN_LORE_INTRODUCTION_0004=I'm also your instructor for <color=white>Air Magic</color>, which means I will be your supervisor for today's field trip in the <color=white>Floating Islands</color>, where you'll be undertaking your first test, the <color=white>Trial of Air</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_INTRODUCTION_0005=Your first task is really trivial. I just need you to <color=white>obtain a Nymph</color>. One of those flying Spirits, you know.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0000=These are your <color=white>first missions</color>...You seem lost, but don't worry, follow me - I think I know where to find a Nymph.
TID_TUTORIAL_INTRO_BATTLE1_01=Look, a Nymph! Let's capture it! There are creatures hidden in each region, so pay attention to the ones you visit.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0001=Bravo, you've captured the Nymph! Now put that theory into practice!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0002=Glyphs are coalesced Magic, refined from Dragonblood Veins and Nexuses - the crème de la crème of arcane enchantments.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0003=Ooh, Look at me with the big words! In simpler terms, they're pretty coloured symbols that make your creatures stronger. Easy peasy!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0004=Now too-da-loo! You all have fun Glyph-hunting!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0005=Good job students! This Glyph is your first step in an exciting journey! Let me show you the best way to obtain creatures...
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0006=Congratulations students! Here's your reward! It's called a Soulstone and it's the Spiritual Quintessence of a Magical creature.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0007=Sorry, big words again! Basically it's a beautiful shimmering thing that you consume at the Summoning Gate, and voilà! A new creature appears, bound to you.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0008=Well, this is your lucky day! Here is another Soulstone for you.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_TUTORIAL_0009=Not all Soulstones are created equal, you know. The purer the magic inside, the better they look, and the stronger the creature they summon.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0000=Gather round students. I have bad news. Unfortunately there's been a slight accident involving Professor Dyson, your Water Magic teacher.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0001=A "slight accident"? I heard he's been sucked into a rift to the Spirit World that he himself created.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0002=Perhaps… But "accident" has a nicer ring. And we don't want you to get in a tizzy and all.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0003=A substitute teacher is already on the way. She's a Naga from Shanriya, the Hidden City. I'm sure you'll like her! Unless you're allergic to snakes of course.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0004=Anyway, thing is Master Belketh has ordered the academic staff to investigate the matter, and that includes me, obviously.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0005=But the good news is your Trial won't be interrupted! <color=white>Sandro</color>, our headboy and, I must say, brightest student, will guide you through the last tasks.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0006=Erm, thanks Professor Yrilin. Well First Years, it's time to prove yourselves and see whether you are worthy of your place here at Akadimia.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0007=Spread out. <color=white>From now on, you're on your own</color>. Show me your best. You won't see me but I'll be there, watching, judging…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0011=What? A <color=white>Dragon!</color> This is our Trial? Are you crazy?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_LEVEL_0012=Dragons... we put too much emphasis on them. They are not gods, little more than beasts really; much like squirrels, though admittedly far more likely to eat you.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_CONCLUSION_0000=Good job. Off you go now, to the <color=white>Ice Caves</color> for the <color=white>Trial of Water</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_CONCLUSION_0001=Is that all you've got to say! "Good job"? We could have been killed by that Dragon!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_1_CONCLUSION_0002=Yes, but you weren't. Now hurry along, <color=white>Professor Sayuri</color> is waiting for you.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_INTRODUCTION_0000="I set eyes upon you for the first time, students. I am <color=white>Mistress Sayuri</color>, your new teacher for the studies of <color=white>Water Magic</color> and Spirit Summoning."
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_INTRODUCTION_0001=You're Professor Dyson's replacement? What happened to him? Everyone is being so tight lipped!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_INTRODUCTION_0002=I would be honored to invite you for tea and discuss this matter, but I'm afraid your next assignment can't wait.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_INTRODUCTION_0003=Let me guess… We have to find a way to breathe underwater so we can dive down to the sunken city of Merfolk and rescue the person we care the most about.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_INTRODUCTION_0004=Saaa… Not at all. You're to venture into a lost Faceless city, frozen deep into the Icy Mountain, and find out what lies hidden and silent in its shadows…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_INTRODUCTION_0005=Brilliant! Is it just me or are you also picturing some kind of dark oozing tentacles sucking at our souls with disgusting sounds and no table manners whatsoever?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_LEVEL_0000=Not so bad first years. Maybe there's hope for you after all. But beware, you're now in the Heart of Darkness, metaphorically speaking.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_LEVEL_0001=One final challenge to go before you can, you know, "chill out"…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0000=Well done students! You've passed the <color=white>Trial of Water</color>, and also learned that working as a team makes you stronger.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0001=So it was just another Dragon... How original! The tentacles would at least have brought some "freshness" to the test…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0002=Do not mock the Dragons little one. They created our world and inspire us continuously, lencouraging us to surpass ourselves.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0003=In the Holy Empire, where I come from, we worship <color=white>Elrath</color>, the <color=white>Dragon-God of Light</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0004=But he's supposed to be almighty, and here we are - first years - defeating two Dragons in a row!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0005=I thought you were more perceptive. The Dragons allowed you to defeat them. They're testing your abilities.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0006=Believe me, it would take you more than a lifetime of magical studies to represent a real threat to any of them…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_2_CONCLUSION_0007=I would love to teach you more about the Dragons, but unfortunately, your next challenge awaits. I must send you to <color=white>Professor MacKay</color>, the <color=white>Master of Fire</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0000=Hey-ho! Welcome lads and lasses, come closer to the fires of my forge. Don't be afraid to get your wee fingers burnt!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0001=Easy for him to say - Dwarves have a natural resistance to Fire. They could go skinny-dipping in lava pools without even feeling a tingle!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0002=I'm <color=white>Professor MacKay</color>, your teacher for the studies of <color=white>Fire Magic</color> and Construct Crafting.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0003=Fire can become your best pal, but ya have to treat it with respect or, believe me, it'll crawl up your sorry arse faster than a cinder louse!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0004=Apologies, sir, but <color=white>Master Belketh</color> requires your presence for… extraordinary academic matters.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0005=Aye, must be this fishy business with ol’ Dyson. Told him many a time not to mess with things ya cannae understand…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0006=Shall I dismiss the first years and postpone the <color=white>Trial of Fire</color>?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0007=No need Sandro, just take these wee bairns up to see ol’ Smoky for me.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_INTRODUCTION_0008=I trust ya to bring them back to me in one piece, not as a heap of charred kebabs!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0000=Hush now... I think we're being followed… I recognize these students - they're first years, like us.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0001=Really, a volcano! Do you realise what that’ll do to our skin? We need to moisturize! Do you know any water spray spells <color=white>Kei</color>?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0002=Shut up <color=white>Liran</color>. I'm trying to focus here. I can hear a rumble that does not seem to be caused by natural causes, and if my intuition is right…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0003=Kei! Look out! There are two other students right ahead, that smartass girl and… er, whatsisname.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0004=Rivals eh? Well nobody messes with MY Trial! Prepare for trouble!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0005=Yeah! And make it double!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0006=Guys, we'd love to challenge you in the arena but now is neither the place nor the time.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0007=Your "Trial" has heard us and he's "warming up" to roast our collective butts!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_LEVEL_0008=It seems MacKay's "ol' Smoky" is *surprise* yet another <color=white>Dragon!</color>
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_CONCLUSION_0000=So lads and lasses, hope you've enjoyed the scenery down there. Dwarven architecture is such a wonder!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_CONCLUSION_0001=But ya ain't seen nothing till you've crawled your arse down the Lost Mines of Doria!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_CONCLUSION_0002=I thought Doria was the famous House Chimera explorer who went missing in the Wyslin jungle?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_CONCLUSION_0003=Missing? She was torn to pieces by a giant blue ape while trying to befriend it!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_3_CONCLUSION_0004=She was far too young to be wandering around a jungle by herself. I mean, what were her parents thinking!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0000=Right then me little possums, I'm <color=white>Professor Berhard</color>, your teacher for the studies of <color=white>Earth Magic</color> and Magic Beast Training.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0001=Your Trial will take place in a forest that's sacred to <color=white>Sylanna</color>, our <color=white>good old Mother Nature</color>, and occasionally <color=white>Dragon-Goddess of Earth</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0002=Here you all will take your next steps and dig to the roots (so to speak) of creature control.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0003=Now I say control, but these little fellows of yours should be treated with respect, more like partners.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0004=Pardon me sir. Headmaster Belketh has sent me to guide the first years through the Trial. Your expertise is requested for… urgent pest control issues.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0005=Go on then. You don’t keep an Angel waiting!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_INTRODUCTION_0006=Really sorry I ain't got time to lollygag with youse all day... I'll see you around when you come back from the Trial.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_LEVEL_0000=I hope the final <color=white>Earth Trial</color> challenge isn't just another Dragon!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_CONCLUSION_0000=Youse all have potential, I’ll give ya that. Just mind them critters and they’ll mind you!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_CONCLUSION_0001=Got to lurve nature, it’s all around us see. Take this cute little hairy critter. Come ‘ere let me rub yer belly. See how he loves it?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_CONCLUSION_0002=Er… sir, that’s Professor MacKay!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_4_CONCLUSION_0003=That's fine. There ya go, that's it. To the left a bit. Ahhh, that's the spot.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0000=Have you noticed that the school’s spirit creatures have been acting strangely?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0001=They are attuned to realms beyond our sight you know. Maybe we should raise this with Master Belketh?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0002=You two, let's put your overly inquisitive minds to good use. <color=white>Professor Sayuri</color> is missing.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0003=Headmaster Belketh has asked me to investigate the nearby Naga city personally to see whether there’s a connection with these strange events.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0004=I'm leading the search team, and you're coming with me.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0005=Do all first years have to go?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_INTRODUCTION_0006=Only the ones I consider expendable... I mean capable.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_LEVEL_0000=Professor Sayuri! What are you doing down there?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_LEVEL_0001=I'm following clues left by Professor Dyson to try and understand what happened to him. It seems connected with ancient Shantiri lore.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_LEVEL_0002=And they're leading to the <color=white>World-Tree Mountain</color>, another important Shantiri site.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_LEVEL_0003=Don't worry I'm going back to Akadimia to tell Belketh about it, and you should leave too.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_LEVEL_0004=Too late. Seems the city was not completely abandoned after all…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_LEVEL_0005=A <color=white>Daimyo</color>! His kind dedicate their existence to a sole purpose; that of the absolute mastery of the art of war.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_CONCLUSION_0000=There you are! I’ve been looking everywhere for you! The nice little candy store, the haunted bathroom, that seedy pub, even the cabinet of secrets...
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_CONCLUSION_0001=And here I find you in these mouldy, decrepit, smelly ruins… Yucky!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_CONCLUSION_0002=But…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_5_CONCLUSION_0003=No buts! Everyone back to Akidimia. The Headmaster has ordered us to leave immediately. Something about a great cataclysm…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_6_INTRODUCTION_0000=Students. Professor Sayuri has told me everything. I thank you for your help, and I've agreed with her that you should be allowed to explore the World-Tree Mountain.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_6_INTRODUCTION_0001=But don't take that as an excuse to miss classes! Your graduation test is getting close…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_6_INTRODUCTION_0002=So that's our Headmaster. He really is an Angel after all! I've seen my lot in the Holy Empire but there's something different about him…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_6_LEVEL_0000=Oh man, this is awesome! I love this place! I used to come here for picnics with my family.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_6_LEVEL_0001=What are you doing! Why do you constantly help these morons?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_6_LEVEL_0002=Morons? But I thought they were fellow students!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_INTRODUCTION_0000=Students, whether by chance or intuition you have found what we were searching for.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_INTRODUCTION_0001=However, though we appreciate your help. We are your guardians and cannot put your lives at risk.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_INTRODUCTION_0002=Dyson was looking for an ancient Shantiri Tomb buried deep in the <color=white>Colossus desert</color>. This area has been devastated by wild, ancient magic, and it's still highly dangerous.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0000=I have a bad feeling about this. Maybe we should have listened to the Headmaster… Let's go back to Akadimia.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0001=Huh, teacher's pet! Chicken out if you want, but I'm going to show who's the real talent here.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0002=Kei, what have you done! You've triggered some kind of mechanism!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0003=Finally my long sleep is over! Though another hundred years or so wouldn’t have gone amiss.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0004=Kei! No! Monster, what are you doing to her?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0005=So much vitality, brimming with magic and youth… Centuries of torpor make you weak and parched, you know?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0006=Kei - she's so pale and withered, she'll die! Do something, please!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0007=Nothing like a snack to perk you up! Now I feel strong enough to summon one of those good old-fashioned space-time continuum exit vortexes.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0008=And while I escape, I'll let you punch your angry little fists on my <color=white>Titan</color> bodyguard. Because, you know, that's what evil masterminds do.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_7_LEVEL_0009=Next time we meet, you’ll need to be of a much higher level to actually defeat me. And I don’t see that happening…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_INTRODUCTION_0000=What have you done? You were told not to meddle! Your disobedience has awakened an ancient evil, a <color=white>Shantiri King</color> known for his mastery of <color=white>Dark Magic</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_INTRODUCTION_0001=I will deal with you later, but now you need to pass the <color=white>Fire Maze</color> if you are to complete this year at all.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_LEVEL_0000=Hey kids, I just wanted to thank you for bringing your friend along. Just what the doctor ordered.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_LEVEL_0001=You monster! We've pulverized your Titan, and now we'll kick your skinny wrapped-up Mummy bottom!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_LEVEL_0002=Well, technically you cannot harm me. I'm just a projected mirror image. You see, I'm still not fully "spellimus invigoratus" so to speak.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_LEVEL_0004=And when I say "kill you" I mean tear your beating hearts, and then your shrieking souls, from your shredded, convulsing bodies. Now, won’t that be a hoot?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_LEVEL_0005=But I guess I'll have to take a ticket and stand in line. There's a huge, fiery, bearded statue mumbling about a "Trial" and crushing your bones to pulp.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_CONCLUSION_0000=We did it, but I don't feel like celebrating... Look at all the first year students, oblivious to everything that's going on behind the scenes.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_CONCLUSION_0001=For all her faults, Kei should have been here with us.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_CONCLUSION_0002=Raise your head little one. There's a time for tears and a time for blood.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_CONCLUSION_0003=Just as the snake sheds its skin to embrace its new life, we must leave the past where it belongs and prepare for what's ahead of us.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_8_CONCLUSION_0004=Overly poetic, but essentially correct. You've all exceeded expectations, and we will need you all in the coming battle against Ar-Kenos.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0000=We have an extraordinary visitor. Please meet my sister, <color=white>Alma</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0001=You're a Sister of the Light! I too am from the Holy Empire, the Unicorn Duchy.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0002=Alejandro and I are from the Bull Duchy. Though we tread different paths, we have always remained close.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0003=Alejandro?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0004=Alejandro is no more. I am Sandro now.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0005=Alma has come seeking aid against a Dark Wizard who is corrupting a border town of the Holy Empire.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0006=The Wizard's description fits our soul-reaving Mummy King, <color=white>Ar-Kenos</color>.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0007=Alejandro, no one is supposed to know!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0008=Don't worry, they have already encountered Ar-Kenos, and they will even join us to put him back in his tomb, permanently!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_INTRODUCTION_0009=The sooner we set off the better!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0000=So the Dark Wizard is indeed our Shantiri mummy, Ar-Kenos.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0001=In the name of Elrath, Dragon-God of Light, I will cleanse this land of your unholy presence!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0002=Oh, hello! Surprised you made it this far.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0003=No not them, you. Yes, you, the one tapping on me with those greasy fingers of yours.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0004=Haven’t you got anything better to do? Why don’t you go take a walk and let me defeat these imbeciles in peace?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0005=Alright, your call. Anyway, back to the pretty lady sporting a white robe and righteous indignation.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0006=Eeny, meeny, miny, moe… It's your soul that I'll swallow…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0007=Alma! Beast, release her or…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0008=Or what? You'll rip your flesh apart until your face is a naked skull and you'll stare long and hard at me with unblinking eyes?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_LEVEL_0009=For someone who has slept for centuries I don’t really have any patience… Maybe I just feel the need to catch up fast.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0000=Really? And this is the best I could get? Doesn’t a villain like me deserve more than a marginal defeat in a mobile game?!
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0001=I was thinking more along the lines of an epic HD massively-multiplayer raid! No?
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0002=Oh well, the Shantiri Empire was not built in a day. But trust me - this isn't over. I'll be back, just you wait…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0003=Alma! No! You were the only one! I have nothing, nothing…
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0004=Calm down Sandro. Maybe there is a way… We'll talk later.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0005=Headmaster, it seems it really isn't over yet. I can still feel the Darkness clutching at us.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0006=It's not merely Dark Magic, Sayuri. Dyson has released something that is even more powerful and dreadful.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0007=Come now students, it is time to return to your classes.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0008=They're not students anymore. They have earned the right to be called Wizards.
TID_MAIN_LORE_REGION_9_CONCLUSION_0009=Wizards! But it's a heavy title to bear and I fear whatever lies ahead will test us to the limit…
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0000=You are now ready to participate in the <color=white>Arena</color>.
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0001=This is where you can <color=white>challenge other Wizards</color>. Every battle will cost you some <color=white>Arena Energy</color>, but the rewards on offer are unique.
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0002=First of all, you need to <color=white>set your defense team</color>. These are the creatures that other students will see when they try to attack you.
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0003=Good! Now try to defeat some other students!
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0004=You've obtained <color=white>enough points to purchase a reward</color>!
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0005=A new <color=white>building has opened</color>. You can now participate in the <color=white>quest of the maze</color>.
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0006=You can <color=white>select a team</color> and send it into the maze!
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0007=Be careful though - your creatures will be gone for a while and <color=white>unable to follow you into the dungeons</color> during that time.
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0008=Sending your team <color=white>costs 1 Quest Ticket</color>. There are <color=white>many ways to obtain Tickets</color>, but you should still use them wisely.
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0009=Check your team's progress!
TID_TUTORIAL_TIP_0010=You can let them fulfill this quest on their own - they don't need your help!
